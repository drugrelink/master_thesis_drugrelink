	abstract = {Lung cancer, characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in the lung tissue, is the leading cause of global cancer deaths. Until now, effective treatment of this disease is limited. Many synthetic compounds have emerged with the advancement of combinatorial chemistry. Identification of effective lung cancer candidate drug compounds among them is a great challenge. Thus, it is necessary to build effective computational methods that can assist us in selecting for potential lung cancer drug compounds. In this study, a computational method was proposed to tackle this problem. The chemical-chemical interactions and chemical-protein interactions were utilized to select candidate drug compounds that have close associations with approved lung cancer drugs and lung cancer-related genes. A permutation test and K-means clustering algorithm were employed to exclude candidate drugs with low possibilities to treat lung cancer. The final analysis suggests that the remaining drug compounds have potential anti-lung cancer activities and most of them have structural dissimilarity with approved drugs for lung cancer.},

PID offers a range of search features to facilitate pathway exploration. Users can browse the predefined set of pathways or create interaction network maps centered on a single molecule or cellular process of interest. In addition, the batch query tool allows users to upload long list(s) of molecules, such as those derived from microarray experiments, and either overlay these molecules onto predefined pathways or visualize the complete molecular connectivity map. Users can also download molecule lists, citation lists and complete database content in extensible markup language (XML) and Biological Pathways Exchange (BioPAX) Level 2 format. The database is updated with new pathway content every month and supplemented by specially commissioned articles on the practical uses of other relevant online tools.},

	abstract = {Accumulation of amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) within brain is a major pathogenic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emerging evidence suggests that autophagy, an important intracellular catabolic process, is involved in Aβ clearance. Here, we investigated whether temsirolimus, a newly developed compound approved by Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for renal cell carcinoma treatment, would promote autophagic clearance of Aβ and thus provide protective effects in cellular and animal models of AD. HEK293 cells expressing the Swedish mutant of APP695 (HEK293-APP695) were treated with vehicle or 100nM temsirolimus for 24h in the presence or absence of 3-methyladenine (5mM) or Atg5-siRNA, and intracellular Aβ levels as well as autophagy biomarkers were measured. Meanwhile, APP/PS1 mice received intraperitoneal injection of temsirolimus (20mg/kg) every 2 days for 60 days, and brain Aβ burden, autophagy biomarkers, cellular apoptosis in hippocampus, and spatial cognitive functions were assessed. Our results showed that temsirolimus enhanced Aβ clearance in HEK293-APP695 cells and in brain of APP/PS1 mice in an autophagy-dependent manner. Meanwhile, temsirolimus attenuated cellular apoptosis in hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, which was accompanied by an improvement in spatial learning and memory abilities. In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence that temsirolimus promotes autophagic Aβ clearance and exerts protective effects in cellular and animal models of AD, suggesting that temsirolimus administration may represent a new therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. Meanwhile, these findings emphasize the notion that many therapeutic agents possess pleiotropic actions aside from their main applications.},

DisGeNET contains over 380,000 associations between {\textgreater}16,000 genes and 13,000 diseases, which makes it one of the largest repositories currently available of its kind. DisGeNET integrates expert-curated databases with text-mined data, covers information on Mendelian and complex diseases, and includes data from animal disease models. It features a score based on the supporting evidence to prioritize gene-disease associations. It is an open access resource available through a web interface, a Cytoscape plugin and as a Semantic Web resource. The web interface supports user-friendly data exploration and navigation. DisGeNET data can also be analysed via the DisGeNET Cytoscape plugin, and enriched with the annotations of other plugins of this popular network analysis software suite. Finally, the information contained in DisGeNET can be expanded and complemented using Semantic Web technologies and linked to a variety of resources already present in the Linked Data cloud. Hence, DisGeNET offers one of the most comprehensive collections of human gene-disease associations and a valuable set of tools for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying diseases of genetic origin, designed to fulfill the needs of different user profiles, including bioinformaticians, biologists and health-care practitioners.

	abstract = {The majority of clinical trial failures are caused by low efficacy of investigated drugs, often due to a poor choice of target protein. Computational prioritization approaches aim to support target selection by ranking candidate targets in the context of a given disease. We propose a novel target prioritization approach, GuiltyTargets, which relies on deep network representation learning of a genome-wide protein-protein interaction network annotated with disease-specific differential gene expression and uses positive-unlabeled machine learning for candidate ranking. We evaluated our approach on six diseases of different types (cancer, metabolic, neurodegenerative) within a 10 times repeated 5-fold stratified cross-validation and achieved AUROC values between 0.92 - 0.94, significantly outperforming a previous approach, which relies on manually engineered topological features. Moreover, we showed that GuiltyTargets allows for target repositioning across related disease areas. Applying GuiltyTargets to Alzheimer's disease resulted into a number of highly ranked candidates that are currently discussed as targets in the literature. Interestingly, one (COMT) is also the target of an approved drug (Tolcapone) for Parkinson's disease, highlighting the potential for target repositioning of our method.

The vector representations of words learned by word2vec models have been shown to carry semantic meanings and are useful in various NLP tasks. As an increasing number of researchers would like to experiment with word2vec or similar techniques, I notice that there lacks a material that comprehensively explains the parameter learning process of word embedding models in details, thus preventing researchers that are non-experts in neural networks from understanding the working mechanism of such models. This note provides detailed derivations and explanations of the parameter update equations of the word2vec models, including the original continuous bag-of-word (CBOW) and skip-gram (SG) models, as well as advanced optimization techniques, including hierarchical softmax and negative sampling. Intuitive interpretations of the gradient equations are also provided alongside mathematical derivations. In the appendix, a review on the basics of neuron networks and backpropagation is provided. I also created an interactive demo, wevi, to facilitate the intuitive understanding of the model.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02269},
	abstract = {Representation learning provides new and powerful graph analytical approaches and tools for the highly valued data science challenge of mining knowledge graphs. Since previous graph analytical methods have mostly focused on homogeneous graphs, an important current challenge is extending this methodology for richly heterogeneous graphs and knowledge domains. The biomedical sciences are such a domain, reflecting the complexity of biology, with entities such as genes, proteins, drugs, diseases, and phenotypes, and relationships such as gene co-expression, biochemical regulation, and biomolecular inhibition or activation. Therefore, the semantics of edges and nodes are critical for representation learning and knowledge discovery in real world biomedical problems. In this paper, we propose the edge2vec model, which represents graphs considering edge semantics. An edge-type transition matrix is trained by an Expectation-Maximization approach, and a stochastic gradient descent model is employed to learn node embedding on a heterogeneous graph via the trained transition matrix. edge2vec is validated on three biomedical domain tasks: biomedical entity classification, compound-gene bioactivity prediction, and biomedical information retrieval. Results show that by considering edge-types into node embedding learning in heterogeneous graphs, {\textbackslash}textbf\{edge2vec\}{\textbackslash} significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on all three tasks. We propose this method for its added value relative to existing graph analytical methodology, and in the real world context of biomedical knowledge discovery applicability.},

	abstract = {The ability to computationally predict whether a compound treats a disease would improve the economy and success rate of drug approval. This study describes Project Rephetio to systematically model drug efficacy based on 755 existing treatments. First, we constructed Hetionet (neo4j.het.io), an integrative network encoding knowledge from millions of biomedical studies. Hetionet v1.0 consists of 47,031 nodes of 11 types and 2,250,197 relationships of 24 types. Data were integrated from 29 public resources to connect compounds, diseases, genes, anatomies, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, pharmacologic classes, side effects, and symptoms. Next, we identified network patterns that distinguish treatments from non-treatments. Then, we predicted the probability of treatment for 209,168 compound–disease pairs (het.io/repurpose). Our predictions validated on two external sets of treatment and provided pharmacological insights on epilepsy, suggesting they will help prioritize drug repurposing candidates. This study was entirely open and received realtime feedback from 40 community members.
          , 
            Of all the data in the world today, 90\% was created in the last two years. However, taking advantage of this data in order to advance our knowledge is restricted by how quickly we can access it and analyze it in a proper context.
            In biomedical research, data is largely fragmented and stored in databases that typically do not “talk” to each other, thus hampering progress. One particular problem in medicine today is that the process of making a new therapeutic drug from scratch is incredibly expensive and inefficient, making it a risky business. Given the low success rate in drug discovery, there is an economic incentive in trying to repurpose an existing drug that has already been shown to be safe and effective towards a new disease or condition.
            Himmelstein et al. used a computational approach to analyze 50,000 data points – including drugs, diseases, genes and symptoms – from 19 different public databases. This approach made it possible to create more than two million relationships among the data points, which could be used to develop models that predict which drugs currently in use by doctors might be best suited to treat any of 136 common diseases. For example, Himmelstein et al. identified specific drugs currently used to treat depression and alcoholism that could be repurposed to treat smoking addition and epilepsy.
            These findings provide a new and powerful way to study drug repurposing. While this work was exclusively performed with public data, an expanded and potentially stronger set of predictions could be obtained if data owned by pharmaceutical companies were incorporated. Additional studies will be needed to test the predictions made by the models.},

          , 
            Identifying alternative indications for known drugs is important for the pharmaceutical industry. Many computational methods have been proposed for predicting unknown associations between drugs and target proteins associated with diseases. To produce better prediction, researchers should not only develop accurate algorithms but identify good features that reflect intracellular systems. In this paper, we proposed a novel method for exploiting protein localization. We generated localization vectors (LVs) from protein localization and propagated LVs through a protein interaction network to increase the coverage of the localization information. The LVs showed distinct patterns among targets of known drugs as well as independent characteristics compared to existing features. Based on the experimental results, we determined that including LVs improves cross-validation accuracy and, produces better novel predictions with real and independent clinical trial data. Moreover, the propagation of LVs showed a positive result that it can help in increasing the coverage of the prediction results.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12920-016-0212-7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The high cost and the long time required to bring drugs into commerce is driving efforts to repurpose FDA approved drugs-to find new uses for which they weren't intended, and to thereby reduce the overall cost of commercialization, and shorten the lag between drug discovery and availability. We report on the development, testing and application of a promising new approach to repositioning.
METHODS: Our approach is based on mining a human functional linkage network for inversely correlated modules of drug and disease gene targets. The method takes account of multiple information sources, including gene mutation, gene expression, and functional connectivity and proximity of within module genes.
RESULTS: The method was used to identify candidates for treating breast and prostate cancer. We found that (i) the recall rate for FDA approved drugs for breast (prostate) cancer is 20/20 (10/11), while the rates for drugs in clinical trials were 131/154 and 82/106; (ii) the ROC/AUC performance substantially exceeds that of comparable methods; (iii) preliminary in vitro studies indicate that 5/5 candidates have therapeutic indices superior to that of Doxorubicin in MCF7 and SUM149 cancer cell lines. We briefly discuss the biological plausibility of the candidates at a molecular level in the context of the biological processes that they mediate.
CONCLUSIONS: Our method appears to offer promise for the identification of multi-targeted drug candidates that can correct aberrant cellular functions. In particular the computational performance exceeded that of other CMap-based methods, and in vitro experiments indicate that 5/5 candidates have therapeutic indices superior to that of Doxorubicin in MCF7 and SUM149 cancer cell lines. The approach has the potential to provide a more efficient drug discovery pipeline.},

However, recent studies show that repositioning of existing drugs can function more efficiently than de novo experimental drug development to minimize costs and risks. Previous studies have proven that network analysis is a versatile platform for this purpose, as the biological networks are used to model interactions between many different biological concepts. The present study is an attempt to review network-based methods in predicting drug targets for drug repositioning. For each method, the preferred type of data set is described, and their advantages and limitations are discussed. For each method, we seek to provide a brief description, as well as an evaluation based on its performance metrics.We conclude that integrating distinct and complementary data should be used because each type of data set reveals a unique aspect of information about an organism. We also suggest that applying a standard set of evaluation metrics and data sets would be essential in this fast-growing research domain.},

	abstract = {Network-based computational biology, with the emphasis on biomolecular interactions and omics-data integration, has had success in drug development and created new directions such as drug repositioning and drug combination. Drug repositioning, i.e., revealing a drug's new roles, is increasingly attracting much attention from the pharmaceutical community to tackle the problems of high failure rate and long-term development in drug discovery. While drug combination or drug cocktails, i.e., combining multiple drugs against diseases, mainly aims to alleviate the problems of the recurrent emergence of drug resistance and also reveal their synergistic effects. In this paper, we unify the two topics to reveal new roles of drug interactions from a network perspective by treating drug combination as another form of drug repositioning. In particular, first, we emphasize that rationally repositioning drugs in the large scale is driven by the accumulation of various high-throughput genome-wide data. These data can be utilized to capture the interplay among targets and biological molecules, uncover the resulting network structures, and further bridge molecular profiles and phenotypes. This motivates many network-based computational methods on these topics. Second, we organize these existing methods into two categories, i.e., single drug repositioning and drug combination, and further depict their main features by three data sources. Finally, we discuss the merits and shortcomings of these methods and pinpoint some future topics in this promising field.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          Drug repositioning, i.e. identifying new uses for existing drugs and research compounds, is a cost-effective drug discovery strategy that is continuing to grow in popularity. Prioritizing and identifying drugs capable of being repositioned may improve the productivity and success rate of the drug discovery cycle, especially if the drug has already proven to be safe in humans. In previous work, we have shown that drugs that have been successfully repositioned have different chemical properties than those that have not. Hence, there is an opportunity to use machine learning to prioritize drug-like molecules as candidates for future repositioning studies. We have developed a feature engineering and machine learning that leverages data from publicly available drug discovery resources: RepurposeDB and DrugBank. ChemVec is the chemoinformatics-based feature engineering strategy designed to compile molecular features representing the chemical space of all drug molecules in the study. ChemVec was trained through a variety of supervised classification algorithms (Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines and an ensemble model combining the three algorithms). Models were created using various combinations of datasets as Connectivity Map based model, DrugBank Approved compounds based model, and DrugBank full set of compounds; of which RandomForest trained using Connectivity Map based data performed the best (AUC=0.674). Briefly, our study represents a novel approach to evaluate a small molecule for drug repositioning opportunity and may further improve discovery of pleiotropic drugs, or those to treat multiple indications.},

However, the rapid growth in electronic clinical data and text mining tools makes it feasible to systematically identify drugs with the potential to be repurposed. Described here is a novel method of drug repositioning by mining ClinicalTrials.gov. The text mining tools I2E (Linguamatics) and PolyAnalyst (Megaputer) were utilized. An I2E query extracts "Serious Adverse Events" (SAE) data from randomized trials in ClinicalTrials.gov. Through a statistical algorithm, a PolyAnalyst workflow ranks the drugs where the treatment arm has fewer predefined SAEs than the control arm, indicating that potentially the drug is reducing the level of SAE. Hypotheses could then be generated for the new use of these drugs based on the predefined SAE that is indicative of disease (for example, cancer).},

Recent studies have showed that telmisartan has the property of PPARγ activation. Meanwhile, PPARγ is essential for tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis. In this work we explore whether telmisartan could exert anti-tumor effects through PPARγ activation in A549 cells. MTT and trypan blue exclusion assays were included to determine the survival rates and cell viabilities. RT-PCR and western blotting were used to analyze the expression of ICAM-1, MMP-9 and PPARγ. DNA binding activity of PPARγ was evaluated by EMSA. Our data showed that the survival rates and cell viabilities of A549 cells were all reduced by telmisartan in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Meanwhile, our results also demonstrated that telmisartan dose-dependently inhibited the expression of ICAM-1 and MMP-9. Moreover, the cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects, ICAM-1 and MMP-9 inhibitive properties of telmisartan were totally blunted by the PPARγ antagonist GW9662. Our findings also showed that the expression of PPARγ was up-regulated by telmisartan in a dose dependent manner. And, the EMSA results also figured out that DNA binding activity of PPARγ was dose-dependently increased by telmisartan. Additionally, our data also revealed that telmisartan-induced PPARγ activation was abrogated by GW9662. Taken together, our results indicated that telmisartan inhibited the expression of ICAM-1 and MMP-9 in A549 cells, very likely through the up-regulation of PPARγ synthesis.},

Telmisartan is a commonly used clinical angiotensin receptor blocker, which has antihypertensive, anti‑inflammatory and antithrombotic effects. In the present study, it was investigated whether telmisartan could exert anticancer effects on ovarian cancer cells through upregulating peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and downregulating matrix metalloproteinase‑9 (MMP‑9) expression. A 3.3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was conducted to analyze the proliferation of HEY cells. A Caspase‑3 Activity Assay kit and an Annexin V‑fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide kit were used to analyze the apoptosis of HEY cells. In addition, a gelatin zymography assay and reverse trancription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction were included to analyze the expression of PPARγ and MMP‑9 in HEY cells. The data showed that telmisartan could significantly decrease cell viability and induce the apoptosis of HEY cells in a time‑ and dose‑dependent manner. Furthermore, telmisartan could also dose‑dependently increase the expression of PPARγ and decrease the expression of MMP‑9 in HEY cells. In addition, downregulation of the expression of PPARγ by small interfering (si)RNA could reduce the effect of telmisartan on ovarian cancer cells and increase the expression of MMP‑9. In conclusion, the results indicated that telmisartan prevents proliferation and promotes apoptosis of human ovarian cancer cells by upregulating PPARγ and downregulating MMP‑9 expression.},

Cultured DU145 cells were treated pharmacologically with telmisartan and GSK0660 (a PPAR-delta antagonist); or by RNA interference with siRNA of PPAR-delta. The treatment effects on cell survival were evaluated with cell viability assay, life and dead cell staining and flow cytometry. Western blot analysis for PPAR-delta protein expression was also performed. The results showed that telmisartan (0-80 µm) dose-dependently reduced DU145 cell survival. Flow cytometry demonstrated cancer cell cycle arrest with increase of sub-G1 phase. GSK0660 partially but significantly restored the telmisartan-treated cell viability. Similarly, siRNA of PPAR-delta significantly reversed the telmisartan-induced apoptosis. Western blot showed that telmisartan significantly increased DU145 cell PPAR-delta protein expression. Co-incubation with siRNA of PPAR-delta inhibited the telmisartan effect of PPAR-delta up-regulation. In conclusion, telmisartan induces prostate cancer DU145 cells apoptosis through the up-regulation of PPAR-delta protein expression. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing of PPAR-delta activity can both reverse the telmisartan-induced apoptotic effect. Thus the PPAR-delta pathway might be a potential target for the treatment of prostate cancer.},

There is evidence that at the clinically relevant doses, itraconazole has potent anti-angiogenic activity, and that it can inhibit the Hedgehog signalling pathway and may also induce autophagic growth arrest. The evidence for these anticancer effects, in vitro, in vivo, and clinical are summarised, and the putative mechanisms of their action outlined. Clinical trials have shown that patients with prostate, lung, and basal cell carcinoma have benefited from treatment with itraconazole, and there are additional reports of activity in leukaemia, ovarian, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Given the evidence presented, a case is made that itraconazole warrants further clinical investigation as an anti- cancer agent. Additionally, based on the properties summarised previously, it is proposed that itraconazole may synergise with a range of other drugs to enhance the anti-cancer effect, and some of these possible combinations are presented in the supplementary materials accompanying this paper.},

These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide \$F\_1\$ scores up to 10\% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60\% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.},

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves.

Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.},

We generated localization vectors (LVs) from protein localization and propagated LVs through a protein interaction network to increase the coverage of the localization information. The LVs showed distinct patterns among targets of known drugs as well as independent characteristics compared to existing features. Based on the experimental results, we determined that including LVs improves cross-validation accuracy and, produces better novel predictions with real and independent clinical trial data.

Incubation of C. elegans with MPTP or its active metabolite MPP+ resulted in strong symptomatic defects including reduced mobility and increased lethality, and is correlated with a specific degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons. The phenotypic consequences of MPTP/MPP+ treatments were recorded using automated hardware and software for quantification. Incubation of C. elegans with a variety of pharmacologically active components used in PD treatment reduced the MPP+-induced defects. Our data suggest that the C. elegans MPTP/MPP+ model can be used for the quantitative evaluation of anti-PD drugs.},

To this end, we have created the SIDER ('Side Effect Resource', http://sideeffects.embl.de) database of drugs and ADRs. The current release, SIDER 4, contains data on 1430 drugs, 5880 ADRs and 140 064 drug-ADR pairs, which is an increase of 40\% compared to the previous version. For more fine-grained analyses, we extracted the frequency with which side effects occur from the package inserts. This information is available for 39\% of drug-ADR pairs, 19\% of which can be compared to the frequency under placebo treatment. SIDER furthermore contains a data set of drug indications, extracted from the package inserts using Natural Language Processing. These drug indications are used to reduce the rate of false positives by identifying medical terms that do not correspond to ADRs.},

Similarity is an appealing approach because, with many fingerprint types, it provides intuitive results: a chemist looking at two molecules can understand why they have been determined to be similar. This transparency is partially lost with the fuzzier similarity methods that are often used for scaffold hopping and tends to vanish completely when molecular fingerprints are used as inputs to machine-learning (ML) models. Here we present similarity maps, a straightforward and general strategy to visualize the atomic contributions to the similarity between two molecules or the predicted probability of a ML model. We show the application of similarity maps to a set of dopamine D3 receptor ligands using atom-pair and circular fingerprints as well as two popular ML methods: random forests and naïve Bayes. An open-source implementation of the method is provided.},

Maximal common subgraphs of two graphs can be found by searching for maximal cliques in the association graph, and we have introduced heuristics to accelerate the clique finding. Our heuristic procedure is controlled by some adjustable parameters. Here we applied our procedure to the latest KEGG/LIGAND database with different sets of parameters, and demonstrated the correlation of parameters in our algorithm with the distribution of similarity scores and/or the execution time.

	abstract = {Elevated levels of the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) are thought to contribute to cognitive and behavioral impairments observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) participates in multiple molecular pathways implicated in AD, and its expression and activity are reduced in postmortem brains of AD patients. PP2A is regulated by protein methylation, and impaired PP2A methylation is thought to contribute to increased AD risk in hyperhomocysteinemic individuals. To examine further the link between PP2A and AD, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress the PP2A methylesterase, protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PME-1), or the PP2A methyltransferase, leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1 (LCMT-1), and examined the sensitivity of these animals to behavioral and electrophysiological impairments caused by exogenous Aβ exposure. We found that PME-1 overexpression enhanced these impairments, whereas LCMT-1 overexpression protected against Aβ-induced impairments. Neither transgene affected Aβ production or the electrophysiological response to low concentrations of Aβ, suggesting that these manipulations selectively affect the pathological response to elevated Aβ levels. Together these data identify a molecular mechanism linking PP2A to the development of AD-related cognitive impairments that might be therapeutically exploited to target selectively the pathological effects caused by elevated Aβ levels in AD patients.},

          Global insights into cellular organization and function require comprehensive understanding of interactome networks. Similar to how a reference genome sequence revolutionized human genetics, a reference map of the human interactome network is critical to fully understand genotype-phenotype relationships. Here we present the first human “all-by-all” binary reference interactome map, or “HuRI”. With {\textasciitilde}53,000 high-quality protein-protein interactions (PPIs), HuRI is approximately four times larger than the information curated from small-scale studies available in the literature. Integrating HuRI with genome, transcriptome and proteome data enables the study of cellular function within essentially any physiological or pathological cellular context. We demonstrate the use of HuRI in identifying specific subcellular roles of PPIs and protein function modulation via splicing during brain development. Inferred tissue-specific networks reveal general principles for the formation of cellular context-specific functions and elucidate potential molecular mechanisms underlying tissue-specific phenotypes of Mendelian diseases. HuRI thus represents an unprecedented, systematic reference linking genomic variation to phenotypic outcomes.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          Drug repositioning, i.e. identifying new uses for existing drugs and research compounds, is a cost-effective drug discovery strategy that is continuing to grow in popularity. Prioritizing and identifying drugs capable of being repositioned may improve the productivity and success rate of the drug discovery cycle, especially if the drug has already proven to be safe in humans. In previous work, we have shown that drugs that have been successfully repositioned have different chemical properties than those that have not. Hence, there is an opportunity to use machine learning to prioritize drug-like molecules as candidates for future repositioning studies. We have developed a feature engineering and machine learning that leverages data from publicly available drug discovery resources: RepurposeDB and DrugBank. ChemVec is the chemoinformatics-based feature engineering strategy designed to compile molecular features representing the chemical space of all drug molecules in the study. ChemVec was trained through a variety of supervised classification algorithms (Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines and an ensemble model combining the three algorithms). Models were created using various combinations of datasets as Connectivity Map based model, DrugBank Approved compounds based model, and DrugBank full set of compounds; of which RandomForest trained using Connectivity Map based data performed the best (AUC=0.674). Briefly, our study represents a novel approach to evaluate a small molecule for drug repositioning opportunity and may further improve discovery of pleiotropic drugs, or those to treat multiple indications.},

	abstract = {Many factors should be considered when an episodic migraine worsens and becomes chronic. Prolactin (PRL) was linked to the origin of pain in patients with microprolactinomas who developed different types of headaches. Our team carried out studies on 27 patients with a background of episodic headaches that became chronic. The patients were evaluated by means of a general examination, a neurological examination and a hormonal profile. Of the 27 patients, 7 of them had an increased level of prolactinaemia. All the patients were women, ranging from 17 to 57 years of age. Four of them had a pure form of migraine without aura, whereas 3 patients had both migraines without aura and tension-type headaches. They suffered from headache for a period ranging from 3 to 32 years and their headache became chronic 4-12 months prior to the visit. Their headache did not change in type, but only in severity and frequency. Two patients had no symptoms referable to high PRL levels; 4 patients had irregular menses or amenorrhoea. One of these patients also suffered galactorrhoea and two of these patients had a microprolactinoma at MRI; one patient was using estroprogestinic drugs, so her menstrual alteration could not be considered. The patients were followed-up for a period of 6-16 months. Six patients responded favourably after being treated with cabergoline, although some had already tried other drugs, which, however, had no effect on their headache. One patient improved after ceasing to take estroprogestinic, in spite of increased levels of PRL. Therefore, on this basis, PRL levels should always be considered when headache worsens. It is an adjunctive worsening factor, which can be easily eliminated.},

Also, it is unknown whether such a phenotype map would carry biologically meaningful information. We have used text mining to classify over 5000 human phenotypes contained in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. We find that similarity between phenotypes reflects biological modules of interacting functionally related genes. These similarities are positively correlated with a number of measures of gene function, including relatedness at the level of protein sequence, protein motifs, functional annotation, and direct protein-protein interaction. Phenotype grouping reflects the modular nature of human disease genetics. Thus, phenotype mapping may be used to predict candidate genes for diseases as well as functional relations between genes and proteins. Such predictions will further improve if a unified system of phenotype descriptors is developed.

Key to addressing this challenge is the elucidation of drug targets, an important step in the search for new drugs or novel targets for existing drugs.

In this article, we introduce a novel framework--Similarity-based Inference of drug-TARgets (SITAR)--for incorporating multiple drug-drug and gene-gene similarity measures for drug target prediction. The framework consists of a new scoring scheme for drug-gene associations based on a given pair of drug-drug and gene-gene similarity measures, combined with a logistic regression component that integrates the scores of multiple measures to yield the final association score. We apply our framework to predict targets for hundreds of drugs using both commonly used and novel drug-drug and gene-gene similarity measures and compare our results to existing state of the art methods, markedly outperforming them. We then employ our framework to make novel target predictions for hundreds of drugs; we validate these predictions via curated databases that were not used in the learning stage. Our framework provides an extensible platform for incorporating additional emerging similarity measures among drugs and genes. Supplementary Material is available at www.liebertonline.com/cmb.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: The identification of interactions between drugs and target proteins is a key area in genomic drug discovery. Therefore, there is a strong incentive to develop new methods capable of detecting these potential drug-target interactions efficiently.
RESULTS: In this article, we characterize four classes of drug-target interaction networks in humans involving enzymes, ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and nuclear receptors, and reveal significant correlations between drug structure similarity, target sequence similarity and the drug-target interaction network topology. We then develop new statistical methods to predict unknown drug-target interaction networks from chemical structure and genomic sequence information simultaneously on a large scale. The originality of the proposed method lies in the formalization of the drug-target interaction inference as a supervised learning problem for a bipartite graph, the lack of need for 3D structure information of the target proteins, and in the integration of chemical and genomic spaces into a unified space that we call 'pharmacological space'. In the results, we demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed method for the prediction of the four classes of drug-target interaction networks. Our comprehensively predicted drug-target interaction networks enable us to suggest many potential drug-target interactions and to increase research productivity toward genomic drug discovery.

	abstract = {The identification of potential drug-target interaction pairs is very important, which is useful not only for providing greater understanding of protein function, but also for enhancing drug research, especially for drug function repositioning. Recently, numerous machine learning-based algorithms (e.g. kernel-based, matrix factorization-based and network-based inference methods) have been developed for predicting drug-target interactions. All these methods implicitly utilize the assumption that similar drugs tend to target similar proteins and yield better results for predicting interactions between drugs and target proteins. To further improve the accuracy of prediction, a new method of network-based label propagation with mutual interaction information derived from heterogeneous networks, namely LPMIHN, is proposed to infer the potential drug-target interactions. LPMIHN separately performs label propagation on drug and target similarity networks, but the initial label information of the target (or drug) network comes from the drug (or target) label network and the known drug-target interaction bipartite network. The independent label propagation on each similarity network explores the cluster structure in its network, and the label information from the other network is used to capture mutual interactions (bicluster structures) between the nodes in each pair of the similarity networks. As compared to other recent state-of-the-art methods on the four popular benchmark datasets of binary drug-target interactions and two quantitative kinase bioactivity datasets, LPMIHN achieves the best results in terms of AUC and AUPR. In addition, many of the promising drug-target pairs predicted from LPMIHN are also confirmed on the latest publicly available drug-target databases such as ChEMBL, KEGG, SuperTarget and Drugbank. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our LPMIHN method, indicating that LPMIHN has a great potential for predicting drug-target interactions.},

	abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases are complex multifactorial disorders characterised by the interplay of many dysregulated physiological processes. As an exemplar, Parkinson's disease (PD) involves multiple perturbed cellular functions, including mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagic dysregulation in preferentially-sensitive dopamine neurons, a selective pathophysiology recapitulated in vitro using the neurotoxin MPP(+). Here we explore a network science approach for the selection of therapeutic protein targets in the cellular MPP(+) model. We hypothesised that analysis of protein-protein interaction networks modelling MPP(+) toxicity could identify proteins critical for mediating MPP(+) toxicity. Analysis of protein-protein interaction networks constructed to model the interplay of mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagic dysregulation (key aspects of MPP(+) toxicity) enabled us to identify four proteins predicted to be key for MPP(+) toxicity (P62, GABARAP, GBRL1 and GBRL2). Combined, but not individual, knockdown of these proteins increased cellular susceptibility to MPP(+) toxicity. Conversely, combined, but not individual, over-expression of the network targets provided rescue of MPP(+) toxicity associated with the formation of autophagosome-like structures. We also found that modulation of two distinct proteins in the protein-protein interaction network was necessary and sufficient to mitigate neurotoxicity. Together, these findings validate our network science approach to multi-target identification in complex neurological diseases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interaction data for a given protein may be spread across multiple databases. We set out to create a unifying index that would facilitate searching for these data and that would group together redundant interaction data while recording the methods used to perform this grouping.
RESULTS: We present a method to generate a key for a protein interaction record and a key for each participant protein. These keys may be generated by anyone using only the primary sequence of the proteins, their taxonomy identifiers and the Secure Hash Algorithm. Two interaction records will have identical keys if they refer to the same set of identical protein sequences and taxonomy identifiers. We define records with identical keys as a redundant group. Our method required that we map protein database references found in interaction records to current protein sequence records. Operations performed during this mapping are described by a mapping score that may provide valuable feedback to source interaction databases on problematic references that are malformed, deprecated, ambiguous or unfound. Keys for protein participants allow for retrieval of interaction information independent of the protein references used in the original records.
CONCLUSION: We have applied our method to protein interaction records from BIND, BioGrid, DIP, HPRD, IntAct, MINT, MPact, MPPI and OPHID. The resulting interaction reference index is provided in PSI-MITAB 2.5 format at http://irefindex.uio.no. This index may form the basis of alternative redundant groupings based on gene identifiers or near sequence identity groupings.},

	doi = {10.1186/1755-8794-3-50},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disease-specific genetic information has been increasing at rapid rates as a consequence of recent improvements and massive cost reductions in sequencing technologies. Numerous systems designed to capture and organize this mounting sea of genetic data have emerged, but these resources differ dramatically in their disease coverage and genetic depth. With few exceptions, researchers must manually search a variety of sites to assemble a complete set of genetic evidence for a particular disease of interest, a process that is both time-consuming and error-prone.
METHODS: We designed a real-time aggregation tool that provides both comprehensive coverage and reliable gene-to-disease rankings for any disease. Our tool, called Genotator, automatically integrates data from 11 externally accessible clinical genetics resources and uses these data in a straightforward formula to rank genes in order of disease relevance. We tested the accuracy of coverage of Genotator in three separate diseases for which there exist specialty curated databases, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Parkinson's Disease, and Alzheimer Disease. Genotator is freely available at http://genotator.hms.harvard.edu.
RESULTS: Genotator demonstrated that most of the 11 selected databases contain unique information about the genetic composition of disease, with 2514 genes found in only one of the 11 databases. These findings confirm that the integration of these databases provides a more complete picture than would be possible from any one database alone. Genotator successfully identified at least 75\% of the top ranked genes for all three of our use cases, including a 90\% concordance with the top 40 ranked candidates for Alzheimer Disease.
CONCLUSIONS: As a meta-query engine, Genotator provides high coverage of both historical genetic research as well as recent advances in the genetic understanding of specific diseases. As such, Genotator provides a real-time aggregation of ranked data that remains current with the pace of research in the disease fields. Genotator's algorithm appropriately transforms query terms to match the input requirements of each targeted databases and accurately resolves named synonyms to ensure full coverage of the genetic results with official nomenclature. Genotator generates an excel-style output that is consistent across disease queries and readily importable to other applications.},

Such set-centric features address a host of applications, including microarray data analysis, cross-database annotation mapping and gene-disorder associations for drug targeting. We highlight the new Version 3 database architecture, its multi-faceted search engine, and its semi-automated quality assurance system. Data enhancements include an expanded visualization of gene expression patterns in normal and cancer tissues, an integrated alternative splicing pattern display, and augmented multi-source SNPs and pathways sections.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxia caused by mutation of the frataxin gene, resulting in decreased frataxin expression, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Currently, no treatment is available for Friedreich's ataxia patients. Given that levels of residual frataxin critically affect disease severity, the main goal of a specific therapy for Friedreich's ataxia is to increase frataxin levels.
OBJECTIVES: With the aim to accelerate the development of a new therapy for Friedreich's ataxia, we took a drug repositioning approach to identify market-available drugs able to increase frataxin levels.
METHODS: Using a cell-based reporter assay to monitor variation in frataxin amount, we performed a high-throughput screening of a library containing 853 U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs.
RESULTS: Among the potentially interesting candidates isolated from the screening, we focused our attention on etravirine, an antiviral drug currently in use as an anti-human immunodeficiency virus therapy. Here, we show that etravirine can promote a significant increase in frataxin levels in cells derived from Friedreich's ataxia patients, by enhancing frataxin messenger RNA translation. Importantly, frataxin accumulation in treated patient cell lines is comparable to frataxin levels in unaffected carrier cells, suggesting that etravirine could be therapeutically relevant. Indeed, etravirine treatment restores the activity of the iron-sulphur cluster containing enzyme aconitase and confers resistance to oxidative stress in cells derived from Friedreich's ataxia patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering its excellent safety profile along with its ability to increase frataxin levels and correct some of the disease-related defects, etravirine represents a promising candidate as a therapeutic for Friedreich's ataxia. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.},
