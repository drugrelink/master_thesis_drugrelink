\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Martin Hofmann-Apitius for giving me the opportunity to work on this project and being very supportive and encouraging when I met difficulties.

I would also like to thank Prof. Dr. Holger Fr√∂hlich for his guidance and advice throughout the project.

To my supervisor Charles Tapley Hoyt, thank you for your guidance and support, and all the discussions, encouragements.

To my colleagues at Fraunhofer SCAI and fellow students, thank you for being there as my accompany and support.

To my lovely friends, to the peaceful but never-stop Rhine, to the silently cold winter, reviving spring, vibrant summer and finally fruitful autumn. All my thanks to this place and time I spent here.

Lastly, to my family, thank you for giving me your unconditional love and support across the whole Europe-Asia continent.
